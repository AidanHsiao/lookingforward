  As a heavy player of minecraft (I believe over 1000 hours invested), I've started my fair share of projects over the years. The biggest advantage of summer is the amount of free time I get. I started a project with 2 of my friends around a month ago, a huge hide and seek map with even more functionality. I've spent a significant amount of time learning to code datapacks in minecraft, which are basically just vanilla plugins.</div>
