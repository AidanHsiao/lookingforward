  Since I'm moderately far ahead in terms of academics (and not in terms of being hard working, you know this), I started taking college classes since summer of last year. The system in place is pretty fantastic, where enrolling in less than 11.5 units allows you to get virtually FREE college-level education (excluding the materials fees). This system is called Concurrent Enrollment, or CE for short, and I believe that d.tech is one of the only schools that have this, although this I am not sure of. I take math and science classes at the nearest community college (CSM in this case). </div>
